# Mockup 1
This mockup is the first one for the main page, I built it from scratch using adobe xd.
All mockups currently are only for the main page. Once we have chosen a design scheme other mockups will be made for the remaining pages as well as the admin page.

Attached is the actual file for the design in it's .xd format with exports of the wireframes and mockups as .png files for ease of view.

## Design Scheme
This portrays a mobile and desktop view using a slide-out nav bar. Aiming to have a balance of text content and images for an attention grabbing and appealing look.

The color scheme chosen was based from a derivative of the colors used in the logo with a bit of tweaking.

It's footer has a subscribe box as well as a link to the github.
