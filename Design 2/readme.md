# Mockup 2
This mockup and all the other ones are done differently from the first. This code written on top of a template downloaded from quackit linked here:  https://www.quackit.com/html/templates/business_website_templates.cfm

Within this folder you will find a .html and .css file consisting of the code for the main page.

Please download the zip, extract it and run the index.html file to view the page.

## Design Scheme
With this mockup I wanted to go for a more professional business-look. This approach should not only draw the attention of other academics interested or associated to the research project but also pull in some views from other R&D groups from outside companies.

The color scheme chosen here is has a green accent using a picture background and white outlines. Text alternates depending on the background.

This mockup features a sticky header, hover animations on buttons, and like all of the other mockups some sort of responsive control flow.
